minismokebox
============

POE-based framework for automated CPAN Testing.

Supports multiple backends, including:

	- CPAN::YACSmoke
	- CPANPLUS::YACSmoke
	- CPAN::Reporter

Installation:
=============

The minimum version of perl supported is 5.6. This does not preclude CPAN testing of 
perls less than this, as the testing framework and the testing targets are two distinct
environments.

The included test-suite requires the following modules:

	Test::More 0.47
	File::Spec 0
	Test::POE::Server::TCP 0.12

The following modules are required:

	Config::Tiny => 2.12
	File::Spec => 0
	Pod::Usage => 1.00
	Time::Duration => 1.06
	POE => 1.0001
	POE::Component::SmokeBox => 0.06
	POE::Component::SmokeBox::Recent => 1.00;
	POE::Component::SmokeBox::Dists => 0.08;

The recommended method of installation as always is to use either CPAN or CPANPLUS 
so that the dependencies are automagically dealt with for you and you have the option
of sending test reports during installation >:)
